    <center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
    <center><p>I am a 51 year old ex construction 
      worker who dedicate his life now to 
      making beautiful functional wood projects 
      mostly out of refurbished wood. I make 
      custom hand made functional wood projects 
      out of refurbished wood or exotic hardwoods 
      whatever you prefer. I do not collect any 
      money from the government and all the money 
      I make comes from these wood projects I make 
      so I want to thank you now for your support. 
      I also dabble in a little bit of HTML
       and CSS code, which is how I made this 
      website that you're on right now I 
      am a jack of all trades. unfortunately, 
      since my accident, there's only so 
      much I can do nowadays, which is why 
      I dedicated myself to learning how 
      to code and making beautiful wooden 
      masterpieces as simple as they are. 
      They are handmade and beautiful.</p></center>
